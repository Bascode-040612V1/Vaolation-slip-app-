```

## 🎯 Offense Logic System

### Per-Violation Tracking
Each violation type has its own independent offense count that cycles 1→2→3→1:
- **No ID**: 1st offense → 2nd offense → 3rd offense → 1st offense...
- **Wearing rubber slippers**: 1st offense → 2nd offense → 3rd offense → 1st offense...
- Each violation maintains its own count independently

### Highest Offense Logic
When multiple violations are selected, the system shows the **highest offense count** among all selected violations:

**Example:**
- Student selects "No ID" (currently 1st offense)
- Student selects "Wearing rubber slippers" (currently 2nd offense)
- **Result**: System shows "2nd Offense" message (highest among the two)

### UI Implementation
- **Horizontal Layout**: Offense indicators appear on the right side of violation cards
- **Badge Style**: Colored badges with rounded corners for better visibility
- **Color Coding**: 🟢 1st Offense (Green), 🟠 2nd Offense (Orange), 🔴 3rd Offense (Red)
- **Consistent Positioning**: Proper alignment with violation names

## 📸 Profile Picture Feature

### Upload Process
1. **Access**: Three dots menu in Settings → "Change Profile Picture"
2. **Selection**: Image picker opens for photo selection
3. **Validation**: Backend validates file type (JPG/PNG/GIF) and size (max 5MB)
4. **Storage**: Image saved to `violation_api/uploads/profile_images/`
5. **Database**: Filename stored in `rfid_system.students.image` column
6. **Display**: Circular profile picture replaces default person icon

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Coil library for image loading, ActivityResultContracts for file picking
- **Backend**: PHP file upload with validation and unique naming
- **Security**: File type validation, size limits, secure directory structure
