# Fixed Offense Logic Explanation

## Problem
The offense indicators were showing random values and not following the proper per-violation tracking logic.

## Solution
Fixed the logic to work exactly as requested:

### 1. Per-Violation Tracking
Each violation type has its own independent offense count that cycles 1→2→3→1:
- **No ID**: 1st offense → 2nd offense → 3rd offense → 1st offense...
- **Wearing rubber slippers**: 1st offense → 2nd offense → 3rd offense → 1st offense...
- Each violation maintains its own count independently

### 2. Highest Offense Logic
When multiple violations are selected, the system shows the **highest offense count** among all selected violations:

**Example:**
- Student selects "No ID" (currently 1st offense)
- Student selects "Wearing rubber slippers" (currently 2nd offense)
- **Result**: System shows "2nd Offense" message (highest among the two)

### 3. Database Integration
- `student_violation_offense_counts` table tracks individual violation offense counts
- `offense_counts.php` API provides real-time offense counts per violation type
- Android app loads actual database counts and displays them consistently

### 4. Implementation Details

#### Android ViewModel Changes:
```kotlin
// Get next offense count for specific violation
private fun getNextOffenseCountForViolation(violation: String): Int {
    val currentFromDatabase = databaseOffenseCounts[violation] ?: 0
    if (currentFromDatabase > 0) {
        val nextOffense = currentFromDatabase + 1
        return if (nextOffense > 3) 1 else nextOffense
    }
    // First time: start with 1st offense
    violationOffenseCounts[violation] = 1
    return 1
}

// Get highest offense among selected violations
fun getHighestOffenseCount(): Int {
    return selectedViolations.maxOfOrNull { violation ->
        getOffenseCount(violation)
    } ?: 0
}
```

#### PHP Backend Changes:
```php
// Track highest violation offense count
foreach ($data->violations as $violation_type) {
    // ... update individual violation offense counts ...
    if ($violation_offense_count > $highest_violation_offense) {
        $highest_violation_offense = $violation_offense_count;
    }
}

// Return highest offense count in response
$response_data = array(
    "violation_id" => $violation_id,
    "offense_count" => $highest_violation_offense,
    "penalty" => $final_penalty,
    "message" => "Violation submitted successfully - {$highest_violation_offense}st/nd/rd Offense"
);
```

### 5. UI Updates
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows highest offense message before submission
- **Individual Indicators**: Each violation shows its own offense count with color coding
- **Success Message**: Uses the actual highest offense count returned from backend

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Violation
1. Select "No ID" (1st time) → Shows "1st Offense"
2. Submit → Message: "1st Offense"
3. Next time select "No ID" → Shows "2nd Offense"

### Scenario 2: Multiple Violations
1. Select "No ID" (2nd offense) + "Wearing rubber slippers" (1st offense)
2. Shows "2nd Offense" message (highest)
3. Submit → Backend returns offense_count: 2

### Scenario 3: Cycling
1. Student commits "No ID" violation for 3rd time → Shows "3rd Offense"
2. Next time student commits "No ID" → Shows "1st Offense" (cycles back)

## Benefits
✅ **Consistent**: No more random offense indicators  
✅ **Accurate**: Real database tracking per violation type  
✅ **Logical**: Highest offense drives the penalty message  
✅ **Persistent**: Offense counts maintained across app sessions  
✅ **User-friendly**: Clear visual indicators with proper color coding
